###youtube-mp3
`youtube-mp3` is a fork of [youtube2mp3](https://github.com/emres/youtube2mp3).  
`youtube2mp3` requires `zenity`, and therefore will only run on linux. `youtube-mp3` can be run in both Linux and OS X. The `youtube-mp3` install script requires `wget`, however. `youtube-mp3` for OS X requires `FFmpeg` which is installed when the `install` script is executed.
